sell company 5 year 8 fig

big database with specific details of all candidate --> out part

Using zoho rather than a custom built database --> fundamental misunderstanding of like what a database is I think
Zoho wants to know what they are like as abusiness like ZR wanted to know

create as much database automation as possible

End goal is to sell this as a Ziprecruiter for Drug and alc treatment
already helped by niche recruitment agency
could create a brand of being a recruit ment agency for a niche --> like robert half. com like before
also wants to create social media interns
they still dont know if they're SBT or SBE --> DBA would be SBE

Still up in the air on name, Berkovich hiring maybe?
